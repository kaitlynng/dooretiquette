Dear door pusher, please try taking 3 steps back, and attempt to open the door once again. Thank you for your kind attention.
Ouch, why did you have to do that.
Congratulations, you have spent approximately 200% more time opening a door than the average human.
Alexa, play 'Pushing on a Pull Door' by For King and Country.
It's as if you never learned how to read 'push' or 'pull'.
This experience isn't any easier for you than it is for me.
